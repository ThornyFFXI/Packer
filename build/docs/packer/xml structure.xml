	<priority> <!--Set which containers will have items stored in them, and which item types can be stored in them.-->
	<!--List all your bags, in the order you want them filled.
	If a bag is not listed at all, it will be as if it does not exist and items will never be added to or removed from it.
	Packer will only store equipment in bags with 'equip="true"' and will only store non-equipment in bags with 'other="true"' attributes.
	If an item is listed in an item node, it will always go in that bag regardless of attributes, unless a GEAR command requires it and the bag is not equippable.  So, you can list equipment in item nodes even if the bag does not allow equipment, for example.
	By default, Packer will move items from later bags to earlier bags to make more space in your later bags.
	If you set 'compress="false"', Packer will not remove items from a bag to make space, only if the items are required to be elsewhere.
	If you do not enable dirtypackets, it is highly recommended that you set inventory as last bag.
	Otherwise, your inventory is likely to fill up, and since items have to travel through inventory to reach other bags you will reach a jam.
	Besides, who wants a full inventory in this game?  Why?  Just don't do it. -->
