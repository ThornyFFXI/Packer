# Packer
Packer is a plugin designed to make rearranging your gear for job changes quick and easy.<br>
It can fetch items from an ashitacast XML, or simply organize your inventory based on it's own configuration file.<br>

# Installation
Do not download the entire repository as a zip unless you plan to compile the plugin yourself. That will not provide the files you need.<br>

1. Download the plugin release zip that matches your ashita installation's interface version from the releases area on the right side.
2. Extract the entire zip to your ashita folder(the folder containing ashita.dll and ashita-cli.exe). Everything will fall into place.
3. Load with '/load packer' or add the same line to your startup script. Packer is a plugin not an addon, so do not use '/addon load'.

# Commands
All commands can be prefixed with **/pa** or **/packer**.<br>
Any parameter that includes a space must be enclosed in quotation marks(**"**).

**/pa validate [required: Ashitacast XML Name]** or **/ac validate**(requires Ashitacast)<br>
Validate will parse the sets section of an ashitacast XML and list which items the XML lists that you do not currently have in equippable bags.<br>
This does not include any items in other parts of the XML, or include tags.  If you trigger validate through ashitacast, include tags will be honored.<br>
Items that are only listed in the body of your ashitacast XML should be also listed in a packer section in sets.  See ashitacast documentation.<br>

**/pa gear [required: Ashitacast XML Name]** or **/ac gear**(requires Ashitacast)<br>
Gear will automatically collect the gear listed in an ashitacast XML while also keeping your inventory organized according to your packer config.<br>
The same rules as validate apply.

**/pa organize**<br>
This will organize your gear in accordance with your configuration file.  It will not specifically gather any gear for your current job.<br>

**/pa stop**<br>
This will stop a gear or organize event immediately.

**/pa load [Optional: Packer Config XML Name]**<br>
This will load a specific packer config XML.  If none is specified, the default file will be loaded.<br>
The default config XML must be located at Ashita/config/packer/charname.xml or Ashita/config/packer/default.xml.<br>
If a character specific config exists, it will be loaded instead of the default config.  If no default config exists, packer will make it on initial load.
